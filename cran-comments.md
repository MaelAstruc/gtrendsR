This new release fixes test issues on CRAN pointed out by Kurt Hornik.

## Test environments

* Tested on Linux (R 4.0.2) using Travis CI
* Tested on Windows (R 4.0.2) using AppVeyor
* Tested on win-builder (both R-release and R-devel)

## R CMD check results

There is one NOTE on R-devel because there are non-ASCII characters in the data which consist of country names.
